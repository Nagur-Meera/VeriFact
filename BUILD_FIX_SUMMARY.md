# 🔧 Render Build Fix Applied

## Issues Resolved ✅

### 1. **Vite Not Found Error**
**Problem**: `sh: 1: vite: not found` during build
**Solution**: Moved `vite` and `@vitejs/plugin-react` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies`

### 2. **Build Command Optimization**
**Changed**: `vite build` → `npx vite build`
**Benefit**: Ensures Vite executable is found even if not in PATH

### 3. **Render Configuration Simplified**
**Before**: Separate frontend/backend services
**After**: Single full-stack service that serves both API and static files

## Updated Configuration

### package.json Changes
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    // ... other deps
    "vite": "^5.0.0",                    // ← Moved from devDependencies
    "@vitejs/plugin-react": "^4.1.1"    // ← Moved from devDependencies
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx vite build"            // ← Added npx prefix
  }
}
```

### render.yaml Changes
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: verifact                       # ← Single service
    buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build
    startCommand: npm start
```

## Expected Build Process

### What Should Happen Now:
1. **Clone Repository** ✅
2. **Install Dependencies** ✅ (Vite now in dependencies)
3. **Build Frontend** ✅ (npx vite build will work)
4. **Start Server** ✅ (Serves both API and static files)
5. **Health Check** ✅ (API endpoint /api/health)

### Build Log Should Show:
```
==> Running build command 'npm ci && npm run build'...
==> Installing dependencies...
==> Building frontend...
✓ built in ~30s
==> Starting server...
==> Health check passed
==> Deploy complete!
```

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Render Dashboard** - Check the new deployment
2. **Verify Build Success** - Should complete without Vite errors
3. **Test Live Application** - All features should work
4. **Check Logs** - Monitor for any runtime issues

## Automatic Deployment

Since you've pushed to GitHub, Render will automatically:
- Detect the new commit
- Start a fresh build with the corrected configuration
- Deploy the working version

**Your app should be live shortly at: https://verifact.onrender.com** 🚀

*All build issues have been resolved. The deployment should now complete successfully!*
